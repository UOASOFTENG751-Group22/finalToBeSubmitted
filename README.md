Note: plotting.py depends on NumPy, matplotlib and pandas. So if you want to run this script to get the plotting result. Please make sure these dependencies have been installed.  

It's better to backup the result folder and plot folder because run.py will regenerate result folder and plotting.py will regenerate plot folder.  

Thank you very much.
